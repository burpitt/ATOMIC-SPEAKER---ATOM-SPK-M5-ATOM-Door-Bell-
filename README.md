# ATOMIC-SPEAKER---ATOM-SPK-M5-ATOM-Door-Bell-

A short and hopefully sweet script designed to create a replayable mp3 door bell sample.

Features:

 - LED State change when MP3 plays
 - Short press / long press with the ability to play two different MP3s (currently set to 2 seconds)
 - Debounce timer for accuracy
  
  Just add your MP3s and off you go! I only stuck one in there as an example, you will need to modify the MP3 file names to insert your own.
